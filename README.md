# SerialTerm

A simple and very basic VT100 compatible serial terminal.

# How to use 

Click on the `hamburger meny` in the top left to access the port `settings`. Here you can change the following:

- Serial port
- Desired baudrate
- Number of data bits
- Parity mode
- Number of stop bits

Close the menu and clock on the button with the `blue lightning bolt`. It should change to `yellow/orange` and the label 
should read `Connected`.

That is it!
